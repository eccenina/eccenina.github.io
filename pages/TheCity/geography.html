                        The majority of Vigan's land area is flat, but Brgy. V, Tamag, and Paoa 
                        do have 20-degree slopes. 36.60% of the 2,886 hectares of land are used 
                        for residential purposes, while 45.18% are used for agriculture.Deeply 
                        cut valleys make up the drainage network along the eastern edge of the 
                        Vigan-Bantay plain. These valleys' patterns are highly influenced by major 
                        faulting trends, especially those that run north and east
                        <br><br>
                        On the north and south, the Mestizo River, whose water release originates 
                        from Bantaoay head water, and the Vigan River, respectively, drain Vigan.
                        The slope of the Vigan-Bantay plain ranges from 0% to 8%, and the relief 
                        is actively level to undulating. Particularly Vigan is largely level with
                        a few hills in the Brgy. The elevation of Tamag, Bulala, and Salindeg, 
                        which can occasionally exceed about 50 meters, is between 3% and 8%.

                        <br><br>
                        The land of Vigan is generally flat, with a slope of 20 degrees at Brgy. V, 
                        Tamag, Paoa. Of the 2,886 hectares of land, 36.60% is private land and 45.18% 
                        is horticultural land.

                        At the eastern edge of the Vigan Banthai Plain, deeply cut valleys form a 
                        drainage system. These valley patterns are strongly influenced by major fault 
                        trends, particularly north- and east-trending faults. Draining from the headwaters 
                        of Bang Taoay, the Mestizo River drains the Vigan River to the north and the 
                        Banthai River to the south.
                        <br> <br>
                        The terrain of the Vigan-Bantay Plain is active from flat to hilly with gradients 
                        of 0-8%. Especially in Vigan, Brgy has some hills. Tamag, Bulala and Salindeg have 
                        gradients of 3% to 8% and in some cases up to 50 meters.
                        <br> <br>
                        The undulations often reach heights of over 600 meters, especially in the north 
                        and east, and the eastern edge of the plain is characterized by steep to very 
                        steep gradients of about 40% to 60%. Vigan Gap Hill, through which the Vigan 
                        River passes, is a major topographical feature in the eastern part of the city. 
                        Gap Hill is about 10 kilometers east of Vigan.
                        <br> <br>
                        The eastern edge of the plain has a slope that ranges from high to very 
                        steep (40–60%), and the relief frequently rises to an elevation of more than 
                        600 meters, notably in the northern and eastern parts.The Vigan Gap Hill, where
                        the continuously shifting Vigan River cuts its course, is the main topographic
                        feature in the eastern part of the town. In the east of Vigan, around 10 
                        kilometers, is where you'll find The Gap Hill.

                        Vigan was once totally encircled by water that jutted out from the shore
                        like a triangle island, according to a chart from the sixteenth century. 
                        Geological observation supported this finding because it could be determined 
                        that the water bodies in the vicinity of Vigan were the primary channels that 
                        were then running in a westerly direction and branching as the river sliced the 
                        Vigan ridge.
                        <br> <br> 
                        According to 16th century maps, Vigan was once surrounded by water, forming a 
                        triangular island from the mainland. This was confirmed by geological observations 
                        showing that the waters around Vigan were a major watercourse that then diverged 
                        into rivers that flowed westward and divided the Vigan ridge.
                        <br> <br>
                        Currently, the Mestizo River flows only through Vigan. There are very few fish and 
                        they are becoming scarce.
                        <br> <br>
                        A brief survey was conducted to collect preliminary geological data needed for the 
                        Mestizo River restoration and development plan. Geologists at the National Museum 
                        estimate that about 450,000 cubic meters of sediment would need to be dredged from 
                        the mouth of the river to the Khao Ayang Bridge, which is about 2.5 kilometers long, 
                        90 meters wide and 2 meters deep.

                        The Vigan Banthai Plain is clearly free of collapse and pointing, except for the 
                        eastern and southern extremities of the plain. A north-south fault runs through the 
                        Pre-Quaternary rocks on the eastern margin. The southern extremity of the plain is 
                        bounded by another tectonic line running northwest and southeast from Santa to Narvakan 
                        and Sutha, and fault lines run from Sinait to Bantai and Santa. Maria.

                        The city's sedimentary and metamorphic rocks include alluvium, fluviatille, lacuatine, 
                        pludal, and beach deposits, which include: stools, coral reefs, and beach rock The majority 
                        of these can be found in Vigan's coastal areas. The type of clay known locally as "burnay" 
                        that is utilized in the production of earthen jars is an important non-metallic mineral 
                        resource that can be found in Vigan. This kind of clay is used to make a variety of sizes 
                        and uses for earthenware. The mineral, which is referred to as Bantog Clay, serves as the 
                        primary building block for bricks. The original building materials for the Vigan's historic 
                        Hispanic homes were these bricks.
